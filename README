I appreciate you looking at my portfolio. As a junior cyber security analyst, I'm determined to use my knowledge and enthusiasm to protect people's and organisations' data and assets
against online threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.
In the past 8 Months, I have developed a deep understanding of cybersecurity principles, frameworks,
controls, and best practices. My most recent educational background includes a Graduate Certificate in
Cyber Security Analytics from Mohawk College where I honed my analytical and problem-solving
abilities. I have also taken and completed relevant coursework in network security, ethical hacking, risk
assessment, asset management, identity and access management, and security controls which has
equipped me with the technical knowledge essential for success in this role.

My experience with group projects and labs exposed me to hands-on cybersecurity challenges and real-
life cybersecurity threats. During my study and practice, I had the opportunity to:

1. Monitor network traffic and identify potential threats as well as promptly addressing security
incidents.
2. Conduct vulnerability assessment and implement security patches to mitigate risks.
3. Developed playbooks and incident response plans to ensure a rapid and effective response to
security breaches.
My strong analytical mindset, attention to detail, and ability to stay up-to-date with emerging
cybersecurity trends makes me a valuable asset to any team. I am also proficient in various cyber
security tools and technologies, including; Splunk, Chronicle, Wireshark, and network packet sniffers.
I look forward to the possibility of further discussing my background and how I can contribute to the security
posture and success of any Organization in need of my expertise and skills.
